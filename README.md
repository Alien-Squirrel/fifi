Here are some tips to prevent chaos:  Take time to write down each situation and how you can help.  Sometimes, you will have to. Consider each person’s situation first and ask yourself if you think it”s okay to make another mistake. Do you want to have another one? Are there other people you admire? Is there a situation you would like to discuss? Write down the situations you are thinking about next. Give each one a try. What do you do when someone‖s mistake is too big? Do we know what to say or do we have a better way of getting to the person? This is a great way to test the boundaries of your mind and body. Let‘s discuss a few examples. If someone asks you about a friend, how would you respond? What would they say? How would someone react? Should they be upset? The question will be asked and the answer will depend on the situation. Read each example and answer the questions. Write out the feelings that you have for the other person. Is this friend upset about something? Can they take him to a park? Or is it okay?

### **8 Sitting Down to Think About the Moment:**
- Sometimes, **sitting down** to consider the possibility of the future can make your mind more vivid. Sitting quietly throughout the day can bring you to a point where you can think about the present moment.
- Sometimes it’s helpful to have another thought and look to the picture to see what it might look like.
- When thinking about what to say or do, **consider what you might have done**. Give a clear and immediate example of what might be happening in your moment today.
- The next time you think you would rather not say the question, you will probably be thinking more about your situation than you actually are!

- When someone feels the need to be present in their life, even when there are other people present, they often feel overwhelmed.  
- We all have our own unique perspective on what our place is in our lives, but that doesn’t mean we should never try.

  - What is the best moment of your day?
  - What are the boundaries of time and space you should not be holding in mind?
  - Ask yourself, *What is it that makes you feel that way?*  
  - If you find that the questions or answers you ask are difficult or hardwired into your thoughts, try to figure out what you can really do to help solve the problem.
  - What do you want to accomplish in this moment?  
  - What activities can you do that will make the difference?
  - What can your partner do when you need help?
